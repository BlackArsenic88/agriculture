Honeybees are currently facing a fragile situation.
Youâ€™ve may have heard or read reports on a decline in their populations due to multiple factors.
The goal of this algorithm is to explore this decline and examine how past patterns can help forecast the future of honeybees.
Data on honey production in the United States has 8 features and 628 samples: 
1. State, 2. Number of colonies, 3. Yield per colony, 4. Total production, 5. Stocks held by producers, 6. Price per pound, 7. Production value, and 8. Year. 

The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) is the primary data reporting body for the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
NASS's mission is to "provide timely, accurate, and useful statistics in service to U.S. agriculture". 
From datasets to census surveys, their data covers virtually all aspects of U.S. agriculture. Honey production is one of the datasets offered.
