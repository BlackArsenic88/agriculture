Project Hive üêù

# Agricultural Data Science & Analystics 
This repository hosts AI/ML algorithms that use data from the **National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS)**, the primary data science and statistics body for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The first analysis focuses on **honey production** in the United States, leveraging historical datasets to identify production trends, regional variations, and predictive insights.

# Value Propositionü™ô
Agricultural data is critical for policymakers, farmers, investors, and researchers. By applying AI/ML models to USDA NASS datasets, we can:
- Provide **data-driven insights** into agricultural production and supply chains.  
- Improve **forecasting accuracy** for commodities like honey, reducing uncertainty for producers and distributors.  
- Enhance **decision-making** at the enterprise and policy level with predictive analytics and visualization tools.  
- Democratize access to **trusted, government-certified agricultural data** through advanced machine learning techniques.

# Features‚ú®
- **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**: Automated ETL pipelines to pull and preprocess USDA NASS data. 
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical summaries, trend identification, and visualization of honey production data.  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Time-series forecasting and regression models for production and yield estimates.  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping honey production by state with interactive visuals.  
- **Scalable Framework**: Extendable to other NASS datasets ans scenarios (e.g., sustainabile agriculture, organic farming, fruits, vegetables, livestock, wholesalers, and retailers).  
- **Reproducibility**: Jupyter notebooks and scripts are structured for transparency and replication.
